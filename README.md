# data-visualization-react


This project presents basic data visualizacitions and data filtering using  data from [Vital Signs](https://open-data-demo.mtc.ca.gov/browse?tags=vital+signs) using [ Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Victory Framework](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/).
I fetched the data from the API [https://data.bayareametro.gov/resource/7e6t-2y8x.json](https://data.bayareametro.gov/resource/7e6t-2y8x.json)
## Spended time, approach and process

I spended 1 hour understanding the excercise and selecting the dataset.I did a previous investigation of the selected technology stack, that took me 1 hour.It took me 2 hours to build the starter project and the basics functionalities and 2 more hours for the details.It was a 6 hours project, but with 4 hours more I could do a dynamic barchart to select the year of visualization and a heatmap of the incomes with the counties using an tool like [React Simple Maps] (https://www.react-simple-maps.io/)
